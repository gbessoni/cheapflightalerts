                        The concept for Cheap Flight Alerts is simple. Travelers have so many resources when it comes to
                        searching for flights. Plus there are many newsletters, twitter feeds, websites and blogs that offer
                        visitors cheap flight deals. We thought, what if we aggregated all these and provided our
                        subscribers a more personalized flight deals feed, straight to their inbox, that provides all the
                        necessary information to spot a great deal and book it.
